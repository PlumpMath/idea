# IDEA

The IDEA framework formalises notions of how creative acts can be measured in
terms of impact and allows contrast and comparison of creative software.

Measures are derived from an *ideal* audiences:
- indication of change in well-being
- cognitive effort spent trying to appreciate the creative artefact.
